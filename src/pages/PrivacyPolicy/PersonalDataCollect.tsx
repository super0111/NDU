        We collect information that alone or in combination with other
        information in our possession could be used to identify the User (“
        <strong>Personal Data</strong>”) as follows:

      <Typography

        <strong>Non-Identifying Information/Usernames</strong>: We also may
        collect other information, such as information regarding your use of the
        Site (“<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>”). We may aggregate
        information collected from users of the Site (“<strong>Users</strong>”).

        In some cases, we may render Personal Data (generally, email address)
        into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy
        Policy as “<strong>Hashed Information</strong>.” This is typically
        accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash
        function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify
        you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.

        <strong>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information</strong>
        : Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your
        Personal Data if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that
        enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with
        your name). But the same pieces of information are considered
        Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only
        with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing
        preferences). We may combine your Personal Data with Non-Identifying
        Information, but NDU will treat the combined information as Personal
        Data.
