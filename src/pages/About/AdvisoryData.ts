      'Kendra McLaughlin (she/her/elle) is a socio-legal psychologist and public health researcher, with a PhD in Psychology from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. She currently lives in Tiohtià:ke also known as Montréal, Québec. Her undergraduate studies were a tumultuous and challenging time; she began in pre-pharmacy sciences, transferred into nursing, and then into psychology at the University of New Brunswick. Her transdiciplinary academic journey has certainly been impacted and shaped by mental illness and the mental health services she did (not) receive at university. In her spare time, Kendra enjoys reading and writing about the intersections of criminalization and mental health. You can find her writings at CriminalizedMentallyIll on Instagram.',

      "Shira (pronouns: she/they) is a neurodivergent, queer therapist in the Philadelphia area. Through personal experience and her work with college and graduate students, Shira has learned about the many barriers and forms of oppression that affect neurodivergent and disabled individuals in academic settings. Shira primarily specializes in eating disorders, disordered eating, and body image distress, and is particularly passionate about supporting neurodivergent, LGBTQ+, and disabled/chronically ill folks in finding freedom with food and body acceptance. Shira's therapeutic approach is informed by feminism, fat liberation, disability justice, and queer and trans liberation. She is a strong believer in the importance of participating in activism outside of the therapeutic space and using her voice to advocate for the systemic changes needed to build a safe, inclusive world for marginalized communities.",
